Ball and Beam simulation

This software implements a real-time simulation of a Ball and Beam plant. The
goal is to provide a virtual ball and beam which can be hooked up to software
as a direct replacement of the physical plant. To that end, the plant
simulation is inteded to execute in its own real-time thread and communicates
with users through shared memory.
